# Forter Exercise
## What did I add?
I added a database to hold all the latencies so that the metrics will be more accurate as time goes on.
I also used a http library that I created and modified for this project.

## How to use?
In the terminal run the project using the following line: `python main.py (int: max_request_per_hour for vendor #1)`
Or you cna type: `python main.py help` to see a small help message.
